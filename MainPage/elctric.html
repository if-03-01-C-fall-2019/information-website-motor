        <h2>Quick info</h2>
        <p>It may be you heard about an electric engine. Its the new rising star in the automotive industry.</p>
        <p>Its highly apraised by experts and ecologist because its really good for the environment. But the</p>
        <p>car culture is quite now not on the side of the electric engine because its missing the beloved sound</p>
        <p>and "feel" of combustion engine they say.</p>
        <h2>Facts about the engine</h2>
        <p>The first practical electric cars were produced in the 1880s. Actually the first few land speed</p>
        <p>were set by cars with electric engines. Until recent years electric engines weren´t commonly used</p>
        <p>in modern cars, but the company really made big moves when they first released their 2008 Tesla Roadster</p>
        <p>which drew a lot of attention from other car manufacturers.</p>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>Electric cars function by plugging into a charge point and taking electricity</p>
        <p>from the grid. They store the electricity in rechargeable batteries that power an</p>
        <p>electric motor, which turns the wheels. Electric cars accelerate faster than</p>
        <p>vehicles with traditional fuel engines – so they feel lighter to drive.</p>
