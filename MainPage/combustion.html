      <h2>Quick info</h2>
      <p>As you might know the combustion still remains the most used engine until today, but how much
      do you really know about it? Do you know how it works, did you know there exist other combustion
      engines than just a V8? No? Then you came to the right place. on this page you can learn a lot
      of new things about engines and cars in general.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Various scientists and engineers contributed to the development of internal combustion engine.
      In 1791, John Barber developed the gas turbine. In 1794 Thomas Mead patented a gas engine. Also in 1794,
      Robert Street patented an internal combustion engine, which was also the first to use liquid fuel,
      and built an engine around that time. In 1798, John Stevens built the first American internal combustion engine.
      In 1807, French engineers Nicéphore Niépce (who went on to invent photography) and Claude Niépce  ran a prototype
      internal combustion engine, using controlled dust explosions, the Pyréolophore. This engine powered a boat.
      The same year, the Swiss engineer François Isaac de Rivaz built an internal combustion engine ignited by an
      electric spark. In 1823, Samuel Brown patented the first internal combustion engine to be applied industrially.
      <br><br>
      In 1854 in the UK, the Italian inventors Eugenio Barsanti and Felice Matteucci obtained the certification:
      "Obtaining Motive Power by the Explosion of Gases". In 1857 the Great Seal Patent Office conceded them patent
      No.1655 for the invention of an "Improved Apparatus for Obtaining Motive Power from Gases".
      Barsanti and Matteucci obtained other patents for the same invention in France, Belgium and
      Piedmont between 1857 and 1859.In 1860, Belgian Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir produced a
      gas-fired internal combustion engine. In 1864, Nikolaus Otto patented the first atmospheric
      gas engine. In 1872, American George Brayton invented the first commercial liquid-fuelled
      internal combustion engine. In 1876, Nikolaus Otto, working with Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach,
      patented the compressed charge, four-cycle engine. In 1879, Karl Benz patented a reliable two-stroke
      gasoline engine. Later, in 1886, Karl Benz began the first commercial production of motor vehicles with
      the internal combustion engine. In 1892, Rudolf Diesel developed the first compressed charge, compression
      ignition engine. In 1926, Robert Goddard launched the first liquid-fueled rocket. In 1939, the Heinkel He
      178 became the world's first jet aircraft.</p>

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>Now you might ask yourself how a combustion engine even works.Let us explain.</p>
      <p>The engine consists of a fixed cylinder and a moving piston.After the piston</p>
      <p> compresses the fuel-air mixture, the spark ignites it, causing combustion.</p>
      <p>The expansion of the combustion gases pushes the piston during the power stroke.</p>
      <p>In a diesel engine, only air is inducted into the engine and then compressed.</p>
