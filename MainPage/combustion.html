      <h2>Quick info</h2>
      <p>As you might know the combustion still remains the most used engine until today, but how much</p>
      <p>do you really know about it? Do you know how it works, did you know there exist other combustion</p>
      <p>engines than just a V8? No? Then you came to the right place. on this page you can learn a lot </p>
      <p>of new things about engines and cars in general.</p>
      <h2>Facts about the engine</h2>
      <p>The first working combustion engine was invented by the belgian engineer Jean Ã‰tienne Lenoir.</p>
      <p>The first car powered by such an engine was built in 1863 also by Lenior. At this time it was one</p>
      <p>of the biggest engineering achivements ever. Most combustion engines are 4-stroke engines, if you</p>
      <p>what that means, it will be explained in a later section. There is a lot of different types of combustion</p>
      <p>engine, for example a I4 an V6 or a W16 and many more. </p>
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>Now you might ask yourself how a combustion engine even works.Let us explain.</p>
      <p>The engine consists of a fixed cylinder and a moving piston.After the piston</p>
      <p> compresses the fuel-air mixture, the spark ignites it, causing combustion.</p>
      <p>The expansion of the combustion gases pushes the piston during the power stroke.</p>
      <p>In a diesel engine, only air is inducted into the engine and then compressed.</p>
